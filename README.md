# 2SH4_Snake_Game
Originally a partner project for a Year 2 programming course, this version of the snake game is made of purely my own work.
This project focuses on combining everything learned in 2SH4, mainly coding in C++, pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and (abstract) object oriented design.
